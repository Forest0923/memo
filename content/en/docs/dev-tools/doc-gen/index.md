### Run Doxygen

The document is generated by running `doxygen` in the directory which has Doxyfile. Otherwise, it is done by running `doxygen` with the file path to Doxyfile.

```sh
doxygen
```

```sh
doxygen foo/bar/Doxygen
```

### Sample

[xv6-riscv-docs](https://forest0923.gitlab.io/xv6-riscv-docs/)

## Sourcetrail

### Install

For Arch Linux, you can install it from the AUR. For Ubuntu, you need to download it from [GitHub: CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/releases).

{{< tabpane "Install" >}}
{{< tab "Arch">}}

```sh
paru -S sourcetrail
```

{{< /tab>}}
{{< /tabpane>}}

### Create Projects

When Sourcetrail is started, the following screen is displayed, so specify the project name and the directory containing the source code. 

Similar to the doxygen example, here is the documentation for the RISC-V version of xv6.

![](sourcetrail01.png)

When you click `Add Source Group`, the following screen will be displayed, so select the appropriate one for your source code and click `Next`.

![](sourcetrail02.png)

On the next screen, specify the directories you wish to create the documents or ignore.

![](sourcetrail03.png)

You can also specify file extensions.

![](sourcetrail04.png)

Finally, press `Create` to create the document.

### Sample

unlike Doxygen, it cannot export documents as html, but you can see source code more graphically.
